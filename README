TetraStack is the well-known Tetris game that doesn't carry that trademark.  I wrote it mostly to get familiar with javascript.

To play clone the repo or just download the zip file and open index.html.  Use the arrow keys to manipulate the falling blocks and the space bar to pause.

Scores are crudely stored at mongolab.com.
