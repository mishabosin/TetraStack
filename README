TetraStack is the well-know Tetris game that doesn't carry that trademark.  I buit it mostly to get familiar with javascript.

To play just open the index.html file and click start.  User the arrow keys to manipulate the falling blocks and the space bar to pause.

The game currently uses no plugins - it uses plain javascript and css.

What's next:
As soon as I have time, I will add some neater effects with css3, and most importantly a better server for safekeeping the high scores.
