TetraStack is the well-know Tetris game that doesn't carry that trademark.  I buit it mostly to get familiar with javascript.

To play just open the index.html file and click start.  User the arrow keys to manipulate the falling blocks and the space bar to pause.

What's next:
Need to keep scores. As soon as I have time I will try out Redis with both Ruby and Node.js.
