TetraStack is the well-known Tetris game that doesn't carry that trademark.  I wrote it mostly to get familiar with javascript.

To play just open the index.html file and click start.  Use the arrow keys to manipulate the falling blocks and the space bar to pause.

Scores are crudely stored at mongolab.com.
